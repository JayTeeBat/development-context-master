# AGENTS.md

## Repository Purpose

Describe what this repository exists to do, for whom, and what is out of scope.

## Repository Context

- Repository name: `<repo-name>`
- Primary language(s): `<languages>`
- Runtime/build system: `<runtime>`
- Key directories:
  - `src/`: `<production-code-scope>`
  - `tests/`: `<test-scope>`
  - `docs/`: `<documentation-scope>`

## Human And Agent Responsibilities

Humans own:

- product scope and intent
- security exceptions and secret handling
- merge and release authority
- approval of breaking changes

Agents own:

- implementation within documented repo boundaries
- tests and regression coverage
- docs updates tied to behavior changes
- running documented quality gates

## Workflow

- Long-lived branch: `main`
- Branch prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- Merge via reviewed PRs only
- Keep PRs small and single-purpose

## Quality Gates

Run from repo root:

1. `<command-1>`
2. `<command-2>`
3. `<command-3>`

## Coding Standards

- Type all production function signatures
- Keep I/O boundaries explicit
- Separate durable logic from scripts
- Preserve public interface stability by default

## Testing Policy

- Logic changes require unit tests
- Boundary changes require integration tests
- Bug fixes require regression tests

## Documentation Rules

- Update `README.md` when setup or usage changes
- Update `AGENTS.md` when operating rules change
- Add ADRs for significant architecture decisions

## Repository Layout

- `src/`: production code
- `tests/`: tests
- `docs/`: durable project knowledge
- `scripts/`: developer or operational helpers

## Change Control Notes

Document any repo-specific API, schema, migration, or operational constraints.
